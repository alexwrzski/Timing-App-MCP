# API Reference

_Generated on: June 18 2025_

# Introduction `(#introduction)`

Welcome to the Timing API reference.

If you prefer a more interactive presentation of the API, you can download our [Postman Collection](/docs/collection.json) and open it in a tool like [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com) or [Paw](https://paw.cloud/docs/migrate/postman#migrate-one-collection-from-postman).

We also offer three Siri shortcuts that demonstrate starting and stopping timers via the API:

- [Start Timing Timer](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/d133a34ae0b64fbd9c6754e4b021298a)

- [Start Timing Timer (letting you select a project for the timer first)](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/489f0dfba0c6493a850699c79363947c)

- [Start Fixed Timing Timer (letting you enter timer title and project name once)](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/6c34c7634382439f9c4fd43cd5065414)

- [Stop Timing Timer](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/50dfcc3566774109954be23c5fff8003)

The "Start Fixed Timing Timer" shortcut will ask you once for a combination of timer title and project name. From then on, it will always launch a shortcut with that combination of title and project. You can create several copies of this shortcut (e.g. by duplicating it), each with a different title/project combination.

# Use Cases `(#use-cases)`

## Using AI Tools `(#using-ai-tools)`

If you prefer using an AI assistant to explore or interact with this API, we've provided a simplified version of the documentation in [`LLMs.txt`](/llms.txt). This file is designed to be easily parsed by language models and other AI tools, making it easier to surface relevant information quickly.

You can load the contents of `LLMs.txt` into your preferred AI system to ask questions, generate example code, or better understand how the API works.

## Siri Shortcuts and Automation `(#siri-shortcuts-and-automation)`

Using the Timing API, you can quickly create Siri shortcuts to e.g. start and stop timers. During installation, the shortcuts will ask you for an API which you can generate [in the 'API Keys' section](https://web.timingapp.com/integrations/tokens) of the web app. Once installed, simply run the corresponding shortcut to start or stop a timer.

- [Start Timing Timer](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/d133a34ae0b64fbd9c6754e4b021298a)

- [Start Timing Timer (letting you select a project for the timer first)](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/489f0dfba0c6493a850699c79363947c)

- [Start Fixed Timing Timer (letting you enter timer title and project name once)](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/6c34c7634382439f9c4fd43cd5065414)

- [Stop Timing Timer](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/50dfcc3566774109954be23c5fff8003)

The "Start Fixed Timing Timer" shortcut will ask you once for a combination of timer title and project name. From then on, it will always launch a shortcut with that combination of title and project. You can create several copies of this shortcut (e.g. by duplicating it), each with a different title/project combination.

Feel free to customize these shortcuts to your liking, e.g. by changing the "Start Timer" shortcut to let you select from a couple of preset titles instead. We are also interested in the shortcuts you create, so please let us know what you build with this!

You could also create scripts that start or stop a timer whenever you perform a specific action; see [Start a new timer.](#time-entries-POSTapi-v1-time-entries-start) and [Stop the currently running timer.](#time-entries-PUTapi-v1-time-entries-stop) for the corresponding API calls.

## Integrating with your billing system `(#integrating-with-your-billing-system)`

The API also makes it possible to integrate with whatever billing system you are currently using. Simply [retrieve your most recent time entries](#time-entries-GETapi-v1-time-entries), then send them to your billing system in the desired format. You can also create a script to create a custom report in exactly the format you need, of course.

Make sure to have a look at the `?include_project_data=true` query parameter to include the corresponding project's attributes in the response. This lets you retrieve project titles without having to do a second API call to the "Projects" collection.

### GrandTotal integration `(#grandtotal-integration)`

The [GrandTotal plugin for Timing](https://timingapp.com/help/grandtotal) already uses the Timing Web API to import your
team members' time entries. To use that functionality, please refer [the corresponding section in the documentation](https://timingapp.com/help/grandtotal#toc-adding-team-members-times).

## Zapier integration `(#zapier-integration)`

We also offer a [Zapier](https://zapier.com) integration. This lets you connect the API to thousands of other services with just a few clicks, solving the problems mentioned above without having to write any code. To start using this integration, see the [Zapier section](https://web.timingapp.com/integrations/zapier) in the web app.

Example use cases include:

- Creating projects for your team members whenever a new project is created in your project management system (e.g. Trello, Asana)

- Importing a list of projects for each team member from a Google Spreadsheet

- Automatically sending finished time entries to your billing system

- Automatically exporting your team members' time entries to a Google Spreadsheet

- Sending a message to a Slack channel whenever you start or stop a task

- Emailing you weekly reports of your team members' logged hours

- And much more...

## Contact us `(#contact-us)`

**We also recommend for you to reach out and [let us know your desired use cases](https://timingapp.com/contact)!**
This helps us prioritize which API features to build first.

# API Usage `(#api-usage)`

The API root is `https://web.timingapp.com/api/v1`. All endpoint URLs share this prefix. Sample code for each available API call can be found in the right-hand column. Note that query parameters need to be URL-encoded, as shown in the Bash example for the [Return a list of time entries.](#time-entries-GETapi-v1-time-entries) call.

## Authentication `(#authentication)`

The Timing API requires authentication with an API key. You can generate a key [in the 'API Keys' section](https://web.timingapp.com/integrations/tokens) of the web app. Once generated, add an `Authorization` header to each request with value `Bearer {{token}}`, where `{{token}}` is your key.

### Rate limiting `(#rate-limiting)`

The API enforces a rate limit of 500 requests per hour. You can retrieve your current quota via the `x-ratelimit-remaining` header attached to every request. In addition, sending more than 200 requests per minute will also trigger a temporary rate limit.

## Request and response data `(#request-and-response-data)`

The API expects requests and returns responses in the JSON format. The actual response payload can be found in the `data` field. Additional data might be provided in the `links` and `meta` fields described below. Refer to the descriptions of individual API calls for concrete examples.

### Repeated fields `(#repeated-fields)`

Query parameters ending with a `[]` can be passed repeatedly. For example, passing `?columns[]=title&columns[]=notes` will show both the "Title" and the "Notes" columns. Optionally, ascending indices can be provided (e.g. `?columns[0]=title&columns[1]=notes`), which makes it easier to build queries in e.g. PHP.

### Date format `(#date-format)`

As Timing is a time-tracking application, its API has to work with many dates. Dates returned by the API will always be formatted as an ISO8601 string including microseconds as well as the time zone, for example `2019-01-01T00:00:00.000000+00:00`.

When sending dates in your requests, we recommend providing dates in a format appropriate to the type of request:

- For time entries, and other requests where the exact time is important, use an ISO8601 format without microseconds but including the time zone, for example `2019-01-01T00:00:00+00:00` or `2019-01-01 00:00:00+00`.

- For requests where the exact time is not important, such as on a report, use a date-only ISO8601 format, for example `2019-01-01`. In this case, the beginning of a date range (e.g. `start_date_min`) will be interpreted as the start of the day in the user's time zone, and the end of a date range (e.g. `start_date_max`), will be interpreted as the end of the day in the user's time zone.

#### Timezone `(#timezone)`

When a timezone is not provided, the default timezone for an unqualified date is assumed to be UTC. For example, `2019-01-01T00:00:00` would be interpreted as `2019-01-01T00:00:00+0000`. This may be subject to change, however, so try to provide a timezone with your request whenever possible.

A default timezone may be provided, using the `X-Time-Zone` header. When this header is set to a valid timezone, any unqualified date is assumed to be in this timezone instead of UTC.

The header only affects input parameters, and all dates are currently returned in UTC. This however may change in the future, so your code should not make any assumptions about this, and always account for the timezone specified in the results.

### References `(#references)`

The Timing API identifies entities via the `self` field, which contains a link relative to the API root, for example `/projects/1`. This avoids any ambiguity about the type of the linked resource and provides you with a convenient way of looking it up, without having to look up the correct API call in this documentation: Simply append the link's value to the API root, resulting in e.g. `https://web.timingapp.com/api/v1/projects/1`.

References should be treated as opaque strings; your code should not assumptions about their structure.

#### Shallow references `(#shallow-references)`

For API responses that contain related entities, these entities are usually referenced in a "shallow" fashion. Instead of including the full object, a placeholder containing only the `self` field is provided, e.g. as `"parent": {"self": "/projects/1"}`. For the [Return a list of time entries.](#time-entries-GETapi-v1-time-entries) call, you can append the `?include_project_data=true` query parameter to include the corresponding project's attributes in the response. This lets you retrieve project titles without having to do a second API call to the "Projects" collection.

### Links `(#links)`

Some responses include links to related queries or entities. This includes pagination and queries for related entries.

#### Pagination `(#pagination)`

By default, collection responses are paginated to 100 items per page. The links to retrieve the first, last, next and previous pages are part of the response's `links` field. Additional information about the paginated data can be found in the `meta` field.

### Custom fields `(#custom-fields)`

Some entities (namely projects and time entries) can have custom fields. These are returned as the `custom_fields` collection, with an entry for each custom field on the entity. Custom fields are intended only for scripting purposes. They are exposed only via the API and are not visible anywhere in the Timing app on your Mac nor the web app.

#### Naming `(#naming)`

Custom field names must be a non-empty string, and may only contain alphanumeric characters, dashes and underscores. Additionally, they must not start with an underscore or contain only digits.

#### Values `(#values)`

Custom field values may only be strings. The only exception to this is providing `null`, which can be provided to remove a custom field.

#### Usage `(#usage)`

Custom fields may be added when creating or updating an entity. When updating an entity, any custom fields not provided will be left untouched. If you want to remove a custom field, you must explicitly set it to `null`.

corresponding other (configurable) columns.

The `include_app_usage` and `include_team_members` parameters govern whether to include app usage (otherwise, only time entries are returned) as well as data for other team members.

The `start_date_min`, `start_date_max`, `projects`(also see `include_child_projects`) and `search_query` parameters allow filtering the returned data.

The `columns`, `project_grouping_level`, `include_project_data`, `timespan_grouping_mode`, and `sort` parameters govern the presentation of the returned data.

> Fetching large amounts of app usage can put a substantial amount of load on our servers, so please be mindful before frequently requesting large amounts of data using this API.

> If no date range filter is provided by setting *both* `start_date_min` *and* `start_date_max`,
this query returns all time entries between midnight (UTC) 30 days ago and end of day (UTC) today.

#### Query Parameters

- **include_app_usage**: boolean - Whether to include app usage in the report. If false, only time entries are returned. Default: `0`
    - Optional
    - Example: `"0"`

- **include_team_members**: boolean - If true, the response will also contain time entries that belong to other team members, provided the current user has permission to view them. Default: `0`
    - Optional
    - Example: `"0"`

- **team_members**: string[] - Restricts the query to data associated with the given user. Can be repeated to include time entries from several users.
    - Optional
    - Example: `["\/users\/1"]`

- **start_date_min**: string - Restricts the query to data whose start date is equal to or later than this parameter.
    - Optional
    - Example: `"2019-01-01"`

- **start_date_max**: string - Restricts the query to data whose start date is equal to or earlier than this parameter.
    - Optional
    - Example: `"2019-01-01"`

- **projects**: string[] - Restricts the query to data associated with the given project. Can be repeated to include time entries from several projects. If you would like to include time entries that are not assigned to any project, you can provide an empty string, i.e. `projects[]=`
    - Optional
    - Example: `["\/projects\/1"]`

- **include_child_projects**: boolean - If true, the response will also contain time entries that belong to any child projects of the ones provided in `projects[]`. Default: `0`
    - Optional
    - Example: `"1"`

- **search_query**: string - Restricts the query to time entries whose title and/or notes contain all words in this parameter. The search is case-insensitive but diacritic-sensitive. Note: this parameter can not be used when app usage is included.
    - Optional
    - Example: `"meeting"`

- **columns**: string[] - Which columns to show. Can be repeated to provide multiple columns. The `user` column is ignored if `include_team_members` is false. Possible values: `project`, `title`, `notes`, `timespan`, `user`. Default: `user`, `project`, `title`. `start_date` and `end_date` is shown when `timespan` column is sent.
    - Optional
    - Example: `["project"]`

- **project_grouping_level**: integer - When this argument is provided, report lines for projects below the given level will be aggregated by their parent project on the given level. For example, when `project_grouping_level` is 0, all times in sub-projects will be counted towards the corresponding project on the "root" (i.e. highest) level in the project tree. Can be a non-negative integer or -1. The default is -1, which indicates no grouping (i.e. all projects will be returned, regardless of how deep they are in the hierarchy). Requires `columns[]` to contain `project`.
    - Optional
    - Example: `"0"`

- **include_project_data**: boolean - If true, the properties of each line's project will be included in the response. Requires `columns[]` to contain `project`. Default: `0`
    - Optional
    - Example: `"1"`

- **timespan_grouping_mode**: string - When this argument is provided, report lines will be aggregated according to the given calendar unit. Possible values: `exact`, `day`, `week`, `month`, `year`. Default: `exact`
    - Optional
    - Example: `"day"`

- **sort**: string[] - Sort the results ascending by the given column; for descending order prefix the column name with a minus sign. Can be repeated to provide multiple sort columns. Default: `-duration`. Examples: `sort[]=-duration` -> Sort descending by duration. `sort[]=user&sort[]=-duration` -> Sort ascending by user, then descending by duration.
    - Optional
    - Example: `["-duration"]`
